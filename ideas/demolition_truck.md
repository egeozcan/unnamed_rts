## 6. Demolition Truck

**Idea**: A high-risk, high-reward suicide vehicle.

**Implementation Direction**:
- **Logic**: Detonates upon reaching target or upon death ("Dead Man's Switch").
- **Chain Reaction**: If a Demo Truck explosion hits another Demo Truck, it triggers an immediate secondary explosion.
- **Explosion**: Large radius, massive damage to all nearby entities.
- **Visual**: Screen shake and large explosion sprite.

**Hardness**: 3/10 | **Complexity**: 4/10
