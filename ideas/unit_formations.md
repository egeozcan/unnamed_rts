## 17. Unit Formations

**Idea**: Move groups in structured layouts (Line, Wedge, Box) rather than simple blobs.

**Implementation Direction**:
- **Logic**: Calculate target offset positions relative to the group center.
- **Smart Positioning**: Place tanks in front and artillery in the rear automatically.
- **Alternative**: Use separation forces (already in engine) with slight biasing for unit types.

**Hardness**: 5/10 | **Complexity**: 6/10
