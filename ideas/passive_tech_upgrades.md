## 10. Passive Tech & Upgrades

**Idea**: Researchable global buffs for unit types at specific buildings.

**Implementation Direction**:
- **Research**: "Upgrades" tab in buildings like the Tech Center.
- **Examples**: Composite Armor (+HP for Tanks), High-Explosive Shells (+Damage for Arty).
- **Logic**: Modifiers applied in `stat_calculation.ts` based on player research state.

**Hardness**: 3/10 | **Complexity**: 4/10
