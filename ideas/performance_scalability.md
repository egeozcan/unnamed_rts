## 22. Performance & Scalability (Future Proofing)

**Technical Considerations**:
- **ECS**: Formalize Entity Component System for 1000+ unit handling.
- **Networking**: Prepare for lockstep peer-to-peer or authoritative server-client models.
- **Web Workers**: Move AI and pathfinding computations to worker threads.
- **LOD**: Level-of-Detail rendering (e.g., units as dots when zoomed far out).
