## 11. Capturable Neutral Tech Properties

**Idea**: Map structures (Oil Derricks, Hospitals, Airstrips) that provide bonuses when captured by an Engineer.

**Implementation Direction**:
- **Capture Mechanic**: Engineer `CAPTURE` action converts ownership.
- **Benefits**: Continuous credit income (Oil), infantry healing (Hospital), or paratrooper abilities (Airstrip).
- **Persistence**: Leave rubble if destroyed; cannot be recaptured if the building is lost.

**Hardness**: 5/10 | **Complexity**: 6/10
