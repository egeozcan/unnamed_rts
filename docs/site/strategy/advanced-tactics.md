# Advanced Tactics

Master these techniques to elevate your gameplay.

## Micro Tactics

### Kiting

Use faster units to stay at max range while attacking slower enemies.

1. Attack enemy
2. Move away before they close distance
3. Attack again
4. Repeat

**Best with:** Rangers, Stealth Tanks, Snipers

---

### Focus Fire

Concentrate all units on one target at a time.

**Why:** Killing one unit removes its damage output. Three half-dead tanks still fire at full strength.

**How:** Select all units → Right-click single enemy → Wait for kill → New target

---

### Spread Formation

Keep units loosely grouped to minimize splash damage.

**Against:** Artillery, MLRS, Grenadiers, Flame Tanks, Demo Trucks

---

### Harvester Harassment

Target enemy harvesters to cripple their economy.

**Best units:** Rangers (fast), Harriers (fly over defenses)

**Counter:** Escort your harvesters, build defenses near ore

---

## Macro Tactics

### Multiple Refineries

More refineries = faster unloading = better economy.

**Goal:** 1 refinery per 2 harvesters

---

### Expansion

Build a second base with MCV to:
- Access new ore fields
- Spread out production (harder to kill)
- Control more map area

---

### Production Tabs

Use multiple production buildings for faster army building:
- 2 Barracks = 2x infantry production
- 2 War Factories = 2x vehicle production

---

## Combat Tactics

### Artillery Positioning

Artillery dies fast but hits hard from range.

1. Keep artillery behind your tank line
2. Target enemy defenses and buildings
3. Protect from flanking attacks
4. Retreat if rushed

---

### Air Strikes

Harriers excel at surgical strikes.

**Best targets:**
- Harvesters (high value, low HP)
- Power Plants (cripples enemy production)
- Artillery (squishy, dangerous)
- Construction Yard (game-ending)

**Avoid:** SAM-heavy bases

---

### Defense Placement

**Layered defense:**
1. Pillboxes at perimeter (cheap, fast)
2. Gun Turrets behind (higher damage)
3. SAM Sites for air coverage
4. Obelisk as final deterrent

**Choke points:** Place defenses where enemy must path through

---

### Demo Truck Usage

Demo Trucks are high-risk, high-reward.

**Do:**
- Target clustered enemies
- Hit buildings (1.5x damage)
- Chain multiple trucks for devastation

**Don't:**
- Drive near your own units
- Use against spread formations
- Forget they explode when killed

---

## Economy Tactics

### Induction Rig Timing

**When to build:**
- After 2-3 harvesters
- When you control an ore well
- Late game for infinite income

**Placement:**
- Defend it—400 HP makes it fragile
- Multiple rigs for unstoppable economy

---

### Credit Float

Don't hoard credits. Floating 5000+ means wasted production.

**If credits pile up:**
- Build more unit-producing buildings
- Queue units in advance
- Expand with MCV

---

## Mind Games

### Feints

Attack one location to draw defenders, then strike elsewhere.

### Scout Denial

Kill enemy scouts to hide your strategy.

### Timing Attacks

Strike when:
- Enemy just lost units
- Their production is in cooldown
- They're expanding (resources spent on buildings)
