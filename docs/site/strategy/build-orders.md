# Build Orders

A build order is your opening sequence of structures and units. The right build gives you an economic or military advantage.

## Standard Economic Opening

Safe opener that focuses on economy first.

1. **Power Plant** (300)
2. **Power Plant** (300)
3. **Refinery** (2000) → Free Harvester
4. **Barracks** (500)
5. **Refinery** (2000) → 2nd Harvester
6. **War Factory** (2000)
7. **Harvester** (1400)

**Total:** ~8500 credits

**Why it works:** Two refineries with 3 harvesters gives steady income. Barracks unlocks defenses and War Factory.

Aggressive opener to pressure enemy early.

5. **War Factory** (2000)

## Economic Benchmarks

| Time Point | Goal |
|------------|------|
| Early game | 2-3 Harvesters working |
| Mid game | 3-4 Harvesters, consider Induction Rig |
| Late game | 2+ Induction Rigs on wells |

**Rule of thumb:** If you have money sitting idle, build more production or units.
