# Aircraft

Aircraft provide mobility and strike capability. They require the **Air-Force Command** building.

## Helicopter

Versatile gunship with sustained firepower.

## Using Aircraft Effectively

### Mass Harrier Strikes

1. Build multiple Harriers (Air-Force Command has 6 landing slots)
2. Wait for all to dock and reload
3. Select the Air-Force Command building
4. Right-click an enemy target
5. All docked Harriers with ammo launch simultaneously

### Anti-Air Defense

| Counter | Effectiveness |
|---------|---------------|
| SAM Site | 400 range, 80 damage missiles |
| Rocket Soldier | 220 range, can fire while moving |
| Obelisk | 350 range laser, hits air |

### Aircraft Limitations

- Cannot capture or repair
- Vulnerable while returning to base
- Limited by Air-Force Command capacity (6 slots)
- Harriers are useless if Air-Force Command is destroyed while they're airborne
