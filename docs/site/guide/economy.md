# Economy

Your economy determines how fast you can build. More credits = more units = victory.

## Credits

Credits are your currency. You start with enough to build basic structures.

**Earning Credits:**
- Harvesters collect ore and return it to Refineries
- Each load of ore converts to credits based on cargo amount

## Ore

Ore patches appear in clusters across the map. They're finite—once harvested, they're gone.

**Ore Properties:**
- Appears as green/teal patches on the ground
- Harvesters automatically find and collect nearby ore
- Right-click ore to redirect a harvester manually

## Ore Wells

Golden glowing spots on the map are **Ore Wells**—infinite resource generators.

**How Wells Work:**
- Wells slowly regenerate ore patches around them
- They spawn ore within a ~120 pixel radius
- Wells themselves can't be harvested directly

## Induction Rigs

For late-game infinite income, deploy an **Induction Rig** on an ore well.

**Deployment:**
1. Build an Induction Rig at the War Factory (costs 1800)
2. Move the Rig to an unoccupied ore well
3. Right-click the well when in range to deploy
4. The deployed rig provides 80% harvesting efficiency infinitely

::: tip
Deployed Induction Rigs glow on the minimap, making them easy to track.

## Harvesters

Harvesters are your income generators.

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Cost | 1400 |
| HP | 1000 |
| Cargo Capacity | 500 |
| Speed | 1.5 |

**Harvester Behavior:**
- Automatically seek nearby ore
- Return to nearest Refinery when full
- Will defend themselves with weak machine gun

::: warning
Harvesters are high-priority targets. Escort them with tanks or position defenses near ore fields.

## Refineries

Each Refinery:
- Comes with one free Harvester
- Processes ore into credits
- Has a single dock—harvesters queue to unload

**Multiple Refineries:**
- Build 2-3 Refineries for a healthy economy
- More refineries = more simultaneous unloading
- Place them near ore for shorter travel times

## Power

Buildings require power. If demand exceeds supply:
- Production slows significantly
- Defenses fire slower
- Radar/advanced features may disable

**Power Plants:**
- Generate 200 power each
- Cost 300 credits
- Build them before advanced buildings

**Power Tips:**
- Watch the power bar—build preemptively
- Power Plants are critical targets—protect them
- Tech Center and Obelisk drain 50-100 power each
