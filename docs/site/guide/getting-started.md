# Getting Started

Welcome to Unnamed RTS, a browser-based real-time strategy game inspired by classic Command & Conquer.

## What is an RTS?

Real-time strategy (RTS) games put you in command of a base and army. Unlike turn-based games, everything happens simultaneously—you build structures, train units, and fight enemies all at once.

## Your First Game

1. **Start a Skirmish** - Choose your slot (Player 1 is blue), pick AI opponents and difficulty
2. **Build Power Plants** - Your Construction Yard needs power to function
3. **Build a Refinery** - This comes with a free Harvester that automatically gathers ore
4. **Expand** - Build a Barracks for infantry, then a War Factory for tanks
5. **Attack** - Select units, right-click on enemies to attack

## The UI

| Area | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Main View** | The battlefield—scroll with arrow keys or edge panning |
| **Sidebar** | Building/unit buttons, production queues |
| **Minimap** | Overview of the map, click to jump to location |
| **Credits** | Your money—earned from ore |
| **Power** | Power supply vs demand—low power slows production |

## Game Modes

- **Skirmish** - You vs AI opponents (1-7 enemies)
- **Demo** - Watch AI players battle each other

## Tips for Beginners

- **Economy first** - More harvesters = more money = more tanks
- **Scout early** - Know where your enemies are
- **Protect harvesters** - They're slow and valuable targets
- **Build defenses** - Turrets deter early attacks while you build up
- **Use hotkeys** - Press `1-5` to change game speed, `F3` for debug mode
