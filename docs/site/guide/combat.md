# Combat

Understanding combat mechanics helps you win battles efficiently.

## Targeting

- **Right-click enemy** - Attack that specific target
- **Attack-move (A + click)** - Move to location, attack enemies along the way
- Units auto-acquire targets within range based on stance

## Stances

| Stance | Key | Behavior |
|--------|-----|----------|
| Aggressive | F | Chase enemies anywhere on map |
| Defensive | G | Attack nearby, return to position |
| Hold Ground | H | Never move, only attack in range |

**Default stance is Aggressive.** Use Defensive for guard duty, Hold Ground for ambushes.

## Weapon Types

Different weapons perform differently against armor types:

| Weapon | Best Against | Weak Against |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Bullet | Infantry | Vehicles |
| AP Bullet | Light vehicles | Infantry |
| Cannon | All-round | Heavy armor |
| Heavy Cannon | Heavy armor, buildings | Infantry |
| Rocket | Vehicles | — |
| Missile | Heavy armor, air | Ground infantry |
| Flame | Infantry | Heavy armor |
| Sniper | Infantry | Everything else |
| Laser | Everything equally | — |

## Armor Types

| Armor | Found On |
|-------|----------|
| Infantry | All foot soldiers |
| Light | Rangers, APCs, Harriers |
| Medium | Light Tanks, Flame Tanks |
| Heavy | Heavy Tank, Mammoth, Harvester |
| Building | All structures |

## Splash Damage

Some weapons deal area damage:

| Weapon | Splash Radius |
|--------|---------------|
| Rocket | 25 |
| Grenade | 35 |
| Flame | 30-50 |
| Artillery | 60 |
| MLRS | 80 |
| Demo Truck | 150 |

::: tip
Group infantry loosely to reduce splash damage casualties.

## Aircraft Combat

**Helicopters:**
- Sustained firepower with rockets
- Flexible, can attack any target
- Must be built at factory level, requires Tech Center

**Harriers:**
- Single devastating strike per sortie
- Returns to Air-Force Command to reload
- Select Air-Force Command + right-click enemy = launch all docked Harriers

**Anti-Air:**
- SAM Sites (building defense)
- Rocket Soldiers (infantry)
- Helicopters can target other aircraft

## Interception

SAM Sites and MLRS have **interception auras** that shoot down incoming missiles and artillery shells:

| Unit | Aura Radius | DPS vs Projectiles |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| SAM Site | 200 | 150 |
| MLRS | 120 | 80 |
| Rocket Soldier | 60 | 40 |

This makes massed SAMs effective against artillery bombardment.

## Demo Trucks

The Demo Truck is a suicide unit:
- Explodes on contact with enemies
- Also explodes when destroyed
- 600 damage in 150 radius
- Can chain-react with other Demo Trucks

::: danger
Keep Demo Trucks away from your own units—friendly fire is very real.
