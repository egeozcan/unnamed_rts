# Production

Buildings and units are produced through four separate queues.

## Production Queues

| Queue | Building | Produces |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Building | Construction Yard | Structures |
| Infantry | Barracks | Soldiers |
| Vehicle | War Factory | Tanks, MCV, Induction Rig |

Each queue operates independently—you can build a tank and infantry simultaneously.
